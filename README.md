(a) LINEAR SEARCH – LINEARSEARCH.CPP

AIM:

To search for a given element in an array using linear search.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

Linear search checks each element of an array sequentially until the desired element is found or the array ends. It works on unsorted arrays.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Input the number of elements and the array elements.

Accept the element to search for.

Traverse the array from the first element to the last.

Compare each element with the search key.

If found, display its index and stop the search.

If not found after checking all elements, display “Element not found”.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully searches for an element in an array using linear search.

(b) SEQUENTIAL SEARCH – SEQUENTIALSEARCH.CPP

AIM:

To search for a given element in an array using sequential search.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

Sequential search is similar to linear search. It checks each element of an array one by one until the element is found or the array ends.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Input the number of elements and the array elements.

Accept the element to search for.

Traverse the array from the first element to the last.

Compare each element with the search key.

If found, display its index and stop the search.

If not found after checking all elements, display “Element not found”.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully searches for an element in an array using sequential search.

(c) BINARY SEARCH – BINARYSEARCH.CPP

AIM:

To search for a given element in a sorted array using binary search.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

Binary search works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and comparing the middle element with the search key, reducing the number of comparisons.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Input the number of elements and the array elements in sorted order.

Accept the element to search for.

Initialize low and high indices.

While low ≤ high, calculate mid index.

Compare middle element with search key.

If found, display its index and stop.

If middle element < key, search the right half; else search the left half.

If not found, display “Element not found”.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully searches for an element in a sorted array using binary search.
